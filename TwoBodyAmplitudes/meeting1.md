## Meeting 1 [2 weeks]

#### Assignment
1. Kinematics of 2->2 scattering, partial wave projection [Martin-Spearman]
2. Unitarity condition
  * for full amplitude
  * for partial wave projection amplitude
3. Analytic structure, resonance phenomena [Grivov]

#### Discussion
 * What is a difference between unitarity condition for PW-projected amplitude to the condition for fullamplitude?
 * How to calculate two-body phase space?
 * How is unitarity related to the probability conservation?
 * How is analyticity related to the causality (past and future, light-cone)?
