## Meeting 2 [1 week]

#### Assignment
1. Short 10-15 minutes presentation items 1,2: (Mandelstam plane and Unitairty)
2. K-matrix [K-matrix review]

#### Discussion
 * What is a difference between unitarity condition for PW-projected amplitude to the condition for fullamplitude?
 * How to calculate two-body phase space?
 * How is unitarity related to the probability conservation?
 * How is analyticity related to the causality (past and future, light-cone)?
