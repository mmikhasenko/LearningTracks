# Meeting 2
## Discussion
1. Omega decay based on [Danilkin]: how ti get from Eq. (15) to Eq. (18)
2. Lorentz invariant ansatz versus helicity basis
3. Potential future problem on (m-1)^2 singularity
 * The original discussion about the non-Landau singularity at (m-1)^2 is in [Bronzan&Kacser]
 * The most recent discussion is in [Gasser&Rusetsky].
 * It is related to a nasty “arc”-problem discussed in [Pasquier&Pasquier] and [Aitchison&Pasquier].
4. The first and second representation of the KT-equations in the [Aitchison&Pasquier].
