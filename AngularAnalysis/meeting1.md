## Meeting 1 [2 weeks]

#### Assignment
1. Representation of the Lorentz Group. One particle state, two particles state [Martin-Spearman]
2. Helicity formalism [Chung, Cook-book, Jacob-Wick]

#### Discussion
 * What is the group _orbit_ in a representation?
 * What is the _Little Hilbert space_?
 * What is a difference between the _canonical_ state and _helicity_ state?
 * What is the main result of Jakob-Wick work?
 * What is a difference between $\left|\right\theta\phi\rangle$ and $\left|JM\phi\rangle$ two particle states?
