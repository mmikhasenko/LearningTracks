## Meeting 1 [1 week]

#### Assignment
1. Complex analysis singularities of functions [S-matrix book]
2. Feynman technique for calculation of loops [Peskin-Schreder]

#### Discussion
 * How to find singularities of a function given in the integral form?
 * What are singularities of function $f(a)$ and $g(a)$ in the examples below:
$$
f(a) = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{x-a}, \quad
g(a) = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x-a}}
$$
 * What are types of singularities?
 * What is analytic structure of $f(a)$, $g(a)$?
